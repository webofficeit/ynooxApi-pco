## Installation

The Pdf4me PHP API client can be installed using [Composer](https://packagist.org/packages/pdf4me/pdf4me_api_client_php).

### Composer

To install run `composer require pdf4me/pdf4me_api_client_php:"dev-master"`


## Getting Started

To get started get an Api-Key and Password by dropping us an email (support-dev@pdf4me.com).

The Api-Key/Password is required to Authenticate. The Pdf4me Client Api provides you already with the 
necessary implementation. You need only to get an instance for the Pdf4meClient as shown in the sample below.

``` php
// load Composer
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

use Pdf4me\API\HttpClient as pdf4meAPI;

$client = new pdf4meAPI();

// using token for Authentication
$token     = "6fghwiIBWbGkBMo1mRDMuVwkw1EPsNhjdS"; // replace this with your token
$client->setToken($token);

// using clientid and secretkey for Authentication
$authurl = "https://******.88888.com/******.******.com/*****/*****"
$clientid = 'edghj@-gkdv-fgffg#-hsokl-fg@ghn'; // replace this with your clientid
$secretkey = 'dgf4567@dfb'; // replace this with your secretkey
$client->setAuthHeader($authurl,$clientid,$secretkey);

# The pdf4meClient object delivers the necessary authentication when instantiating the different pdf4meClients such as for instance Merge

$pdfMerge = $client->pdf4me()->pdfMerge([
          "documents"=> [
              [
		'name' => 'test1.pdf',
    		'docData' => $client->getFileData('/var/www/test1.pdf')
], [
		'name' => 'test.pdf',
    		'docData' => $client->getFileData('/var/www/test.pdf')
]]

    ]);

print_r($pdfMerge);
```
